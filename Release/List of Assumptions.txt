List of Assumptions

The following assumptions were made, whilst developing a solution:

-The use of the following win32 libraries were allowed - GLFW, OpenGL, GLEW, SOIL
-Assumption the animation was 2d, and 8 png files (animation frame) were to be used; Note, I obtained a simple 8 frame 2D animation off a colleague. 
-Following the above assumption I assumed an orthographic view would be acceptable.
-Assumed a minimum window size would be 800x600, it has been designed to be resized to larger dimensions.
-Assumed anywhere beyond the edges of the screen, meant just sitting anywhere on the outside border, e.g.
	-x not being less than the -size.x of the logo width or x being greater than window width
	-y not being less than the -size.y of the logo height or y being greater than window height
-Following the above assumption, I assumed the position would be randomly generated, given these constraints.
-Assumed entry direction would be fixed given its starting location. e.g
	-NW quadrant - south-east direction
	-SW quadrant - north-east direction
	-NE quadrant - south-west direction
	-SE quadrant - north-west direction
-Assumed the demo would need the option to exit the animation, this has been implemented; 
	-the user can press "P" to cancel the animation 
	-the user can press "R" to restart it 
	-the user can press "Esc" to terminate the application.
